Now once we have signed up  we want to directly or auto  Login
I dont want that once I sign up and the user is registered in the database , I 
re login yet again...no that doesn't happen in so many websites.
so How will I do it?
LOGIN AFTER SIGNUP :-
Passport's login method automatically establishes a login session
We can invoke login to automatically login a user

req.login(registeredUser  , (err) = > {
    if(err)
    {
        next(err);
    }

    req.flash("sucess" , "Welcome to Nomad Nest!");
    res.redirect("/listings"); 

})


//POST-LOGIN PAGE
now for example there is a user and they were simply scrolling the site
they thought of adding a new listings
when they went to add new listing functionality , we gave them a pop up
for you need to signup /login before adding listing and stuff...
now for example this user signs up or logins , usko /listings wala PAGE
hi dobara render hota hai isn't it inconvenient for the user ? yes it is
to deal with this what we will do is storing the origianl url
bole ton jo page user actually mein access krna chahta tha
in the first place hum log in ke baad same original url pr hi usko 
redirect krdenge

// path > login > path
/*
We store the value of redirecturl in res.locals . 
Locals variables are available everywhere and passport
 does not have the authority to tamper the value of res.locals.
*/
