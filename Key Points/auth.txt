> Authentication : It is the process of verifying who someone is
> Authorization : It is the process of verifying what specific applications 
, files and data a user has access to 

> Signup/Login : part of Authentication

>Reviews for example can only be deleted by those
users who have created it : This is part of Authorization

>The concept of STORING PASSWORDS
We never store the passwords as it is. We store their hashed form.
eg: Password is "helloworld" using hashing function
 how it is stored? "9fhjdh9387847483793ndmnf89849448nmdnc"
 converted into a undreadable string - hashed form

 >A sweet thing about hashing function is if input is same 
 the output is also same. 

 >Password hamare database store nhi hota
 >Uss password ko hashing function ke through pass 
 krne pr jo output aata hai vo hashed form store hota hai database mein

 >Important characterstics of Hashing function
 1. For every input , there is a fixed output
 2. They are one-way functions , we cant get input from output
 3.For a different input , there is a different output but of same length
 4.Small changes in input should bring large changes in output

 > Different examples of hashing functions:
 SHA256 , MD5 , CRC , Bcrypt

 > lets talk about salting :
 It is a technique to protect passwords stored in databases
 by adding a string of 32 or more characters and then hashing them

> eg : I have a password named "abc" and salt is string lets say ->
salt = "%?@" and then we add salt which becomes something like 
abc%?@ and now iss salted password ki hashed form is stored in database

>what does hackers do ? They build reverse lookup tables in which They
have hashed forms and on basis of that they hack passwords

>So which tool are we going to be using for Authentication and Authorization?
It is going to be passport (library especially in node.js)

>Passport : is a Express compatible Authentication middleware for Node.js
 
> npm i passport , npm i passport-local , npm i passport-local-mongoose(for mongo db functionality)

>Hum different dtrategies use lr skte hai for Passport but we will use
the local startegy for now one
