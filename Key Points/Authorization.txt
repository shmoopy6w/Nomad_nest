    Authorization : It talks about which user has the 
    permission to use various functionalities
    on website.

    //Now Starting with authorization 
    how can we do it?
    1. first is that we can hide the edit and delete button
    for users who are not owners !
    2. For doing this we need to know two major things:-
    a) Who is the owner of a given listing (show.ejs) -> ._id
    b) Which user is trying to edit/delete 
    user(currUser stored in res.locals.currUser) -> currUser._id


    //setting Authorization for Listings
    1. We will first find listing owner from the database 
    and then we will find whether the user trying to update for example
    a listing has same id as of owner of the listing 
    kya vo listing ka owner hai bhi ya nhi


    //setting Authorization for reviews
    1) every review shoulf have an author who created 
    and this author only has the option to delete the review

    2)No user has not logged in into the website can write a review
    its like saying youtube pr incognito se review daal rhe ho aap jo ki nhi hota
