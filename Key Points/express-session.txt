> An attempt to make our session stateful
> session ke regarding kuch bhi info ko hum server side pr
  save krwate hai by making a session id
> express session client side ko sirf session id bhejta hai
>Aur ye cheex browser mein save hojegi in form of cookies

> Now about basics? Https is stateless protocol 
  So jab hum website pr ek page se dusre page pr hop krte hai
  for ex hum electronics page pr the I added airpods in the cart
  now I move to beauty section and there I add lipstick...
  do you think airpods would still be in my cart if there is
  no express session. 
  The answer is no.
  Without session these things won't be stored.
  Only the permanent things are stored in database.
  Temporary storage mein fir humko ye cheezein save krwani
  hai. (express sesion)


>expression session is basically a npm package

>A very important option in session is "secret"
>session id a signed cookie , so it must be a secret

> we use our session as a middleware
app.use(session({
    secret : "mysupersecretstring",
    resave : false;
    saveUninitialized : true,
 })
);

> a thing to notice is that if we open same link in two 
different apps the cookies if we observe carefully are same
what does this mean? It means that even in same browser it 
is being treated as same session.
Backend mein track ho rha hai that it is the same user

>req.session tracks our single session
>req.session.count helps us find count of how many times
a request has been made

> Stateful protocol : chances are the req and res are different
>Stateless protocol : req and res are usually same

>STORING AND USING SESSION INFO
single session works on different routes

>Connecting Login route
How to check if user is logged in? 
req.isAuthenticated()  //passport method
